# Final Project

## Getting Started
There are some things that might need to be change when you first download the program. 
There are some files in the program will be read, so if needed please change the directory as needed.
```
	//reading file called "students.csv" into the vector
	readStudentData(studentInfoData, "cs20-final-project-StephenHu04/students.csv");
	//reading file called "appointments.csv" into the vector
	readAppointments(appointmentData, "cs20-final-project-StephenHu04/appointments.csv");
```

## Notes
* There will be parallel vectors for both the dictionary and priority queue that will help in printing out the information.
